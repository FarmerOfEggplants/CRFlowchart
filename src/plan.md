This is a flowchart that I am making for a US History project.

How I want the flowchart to look:
    -I want it to be in chronological order
    -Events should have 3 categories of content:
        -Backround info/Context
        -Outcome
        -Impact
    -Each event will be a button, that upon clicked will give you information about it.
    -Show how one event impacted another using vector lines
        -Upon clicking a said vector line, it will give you info on how the events are connected.
    -I want pictures associated with each event, possibly more if it feels necessary.

How I should (probably) code this:
    -Make components that can be reused.
        -One to be used by every event button, including descriptions, title, etc.
        -One to be used by every vector line.
